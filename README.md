# AI Development Workflow Templates

A community-driven repository of AI agent templates, playbooks, and task definitions for coding workflows. This project provides a collection of standardized, reusable templates that enable AI agents to assist developers more effectively.

## Vision

- **Standardize AI-assisted workflows** across different development scenarios
- **Improve AI agent effectiveness** through clear, structured instructions
- **Reduce setup time** for common development tasks
- **Promote best practices** in AI-assisted development
- **Build a community** of contributors sharing knowledge and workflows

## Available Templates

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [001_task_planning_template.md](001_task_planning_template.md) | A systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. |
| [002_bug_fix_template.md](002_bug_fix_template.md) | A structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and resolving bugs. |
| [003_code_review_template.md](003_code_review_template.md) | A comprehensive template for conducting thorough code reviews. |
| [004_git_commit_workflow.md](004_git_commit_workflow.md) | A workflow for creating clear, consistent, and conventional git commits. |

## How to Use

These templates are designed to be used by AI coding assistants. To use a template:

1.  Identify the task you want to perform (e.g., plan a new feature, fix a bug).
2.  Choose the corresponding template from this repository.
3.  Copy the content of the template.
4.  Paste it into your AI assistant's chat window and fill in the `TODO` sections.
5.  The AI agent will then follow the instructions in the template to complete the task.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a workflow that could be standardized into a template, please consider contributing. Our goal is to build a comprehensive library of templates for all aspects of software development.
