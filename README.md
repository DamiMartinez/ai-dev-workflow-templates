# AI Development Workflow Templates

A community-driven repository of AI agent templates, playbooks, and task definitions for coding workflows. This project provides a collection of standardized, reusable templates that enable AI agents to assist developers more effectively.

## Vision

- **Standardize AI-assisted workflows** across different development scenarios
- **Improve AI agent effectiveness** through clear, structured instructions
- **Reduce setup time** for common development tasks
- **Promote best practices** in AI-assisted development
- **Build a community** of contributors sharing knowledge and workflows

## Available Templates

| File | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [001_task_planning_template.md](001_task_planning_template.md) | A systematic framework for planning and executing technical projects with AI assistance. |
| [002_bug_fix_template.md](002_bug_fix_template.md) | A structured approach to identifying, analyzing, and resolving bugs. |
| [003_code_review_template.md](003_code_review_template.md) | A comprehensive template for conducting thorough code reviews. |
| [004_git_commit_workflow.md](004_git_commit_workflow.md) | A workflow for creating clear, consistent, and conventional git commits. |

## How to Use

These templates are designed to be used by AI coding assistants following a standardized workflow:

1. **Explain your request** to your coding assistant (e.g., "I need to fix a bug in my authentication system" or "I want to add a new feature for user profiles").

2. **The AI assistant automatically:**
   - Reviews the `AGENTS.md` file to understand the workflow
   - Identifies the appropriate template based on your request:
     - Bug fixes → `002_bug_fix_template.md`
     - New features/development → `001_task_planning_template.md`
     - Code reviews → `003_code_review_template.md`
     - Git commits → `004_git_commit_workflow.md`
   - Follows the template's instructions to complete your task

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! If you have a workflow that could be standardized into a template, please consider contributing. Our goal is to build a comprehensive library of templates for all aspects of software development.
