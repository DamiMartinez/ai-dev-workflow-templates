# Contributing to AI Development Workflow Templates

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the AI Development Workflow Templates project! This document provides guidelines for contributing new workflow templates and improving existing ones.

## Project Vision

The AI Development Workflow Templates project aims to create a comprehensive collection of standardized, reusable templates that enable AI agents to assist developers more effectively. Our goal is to:

- **Standardize AI-assisted workflows** across different development scenarios
- **Improve AI agent effectiveness** through clear, structured instructions
- **Reduce setup time** for common development tasks
- **Promote best practices** in AI-assisted development
- **Build a community** of contributors sharing knowledge and workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of markdown formatting
- Familiarity with AI-assisted development workflows
- Understanding of the project's purpose and existing templates

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Create a new branch for your contribution
4. Review existing templates to understand the structure and style

### Development Workflow

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`
2. **Make your changes** following the guidelines in this document
3. **Test your template** with a real scenario
4. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description
5. **Respond to feedback** and make necessary revisions

## Template Structure

All templates must follow a consistent structure to ensure they integrate seamlessly with the AI agent workflow system. Here's the required format:

### Required Sections

1. **Header with Template Information**
   - Template title
   - Brief description of the template's purpose
   - "About This Template" section explaining usage

2. **Core Content Sections**
   - Numbered sections (1, 2, 3, etc.)
   - Clear, actionable subsections
   - TODO placeholders for customization
   - Checkboxes for tracking progress

3. **AI Agent Instructions**
   - Mandatory process steps
   - Communication preferences
   - Quality standards
   - Implementation guidelines

### Template Format Example

```markdown
# [Template Name]

> **About This Template:** [Brief description of what this template does and when to use it]

---

## 1. [First Section]

### [Subsection Title]
[Content with TODO placeholders for customization]

---

## 2. [Second Section]
[More content...]

---

## [N]. AI Agent Instructions

### [Process Name]

## Creating New Templates

### Step 1: Choose Your Template Type

Consider what workflow or process would benefit from AI assistance. Common categories include:

- **Development Workflows** (task planning, bug fixes, code reviews)
- **DevOps & Deployment** (CI/CD, infrastructure, monitoring)
- **Documentation** (API docs, user guides, technical writing)
- **Testing** (test planning, test automation, quality assurance)
- **Project Management** (sprint planning, retrospectives, requirements gathering)
- **Security** (security audits, vulnerability assessments, compliance)

### Step 2: Plan Your Template Structure

Before writing, outline:
- What problem does this template solve?
- What are the key steps in the process?
- What information does an AI agent need to execute this workflow?
- What are the quality standards and best practices?

### Step 3: Write the Template

Follow these guidelines:

1. **Use clear, descriptive headings**
2. **Include TODO placeholders** for customization
3. **Provide specific instructions** for AI agents
4. **Include checklists** for progress tracking
5. **Add examples** where helpful
6. **Keep it comprehensive** but not overwhelming

### Step 4: Add AI Agent Instructions

Every template must include a section with specific instructions for AI agents, including:
- Mandatory process steps
- Communication preferences
- Quality standards
- Error handling procedures

### Step 5: Test Your Template

Before submitting, thoroughly test your template:

1. **Use it yourself**: Follow the template with a real project scenario
2. **Test with AI agents**: If possible, test with actual AI tools
3. **Check completeness**: Ensure all sections are filled out properly
4. **Verify formatting**: Check markdown rendering and structure
5. **Validate instructions**: Confirm AI agent instructions are clear and actionable

## Template Naming Convention

Templates must follow this naming pattern:

```
[number]_[descriptive_name]_template.md
```

Examples:
- `005_deployment_workflow_template.md`
- `006_security_audit_template.md`
- `007_documentation_generation_template.md`
- `008_performance_optimization_template.md`

### Numbering Guidelines

- Use zero-padded 3-digit numbers (001, 002, 003, etc.)
- Numbers should be assigned sequentially
- Check existing templates to determine the next available number
- If you're unsure about numbering, submit your template and we'll assign the appropriate number

## Quality Standards

### Content Quality

- **Clarity**: Use clear, concise language
- **Completeness**: Cover all necessary steps and considerations
- **Accuracy**: Ensure technical accuracy and best practices
- **Consistency**: Follow the established format and style
- **Actionability**: Provide specific, actionable instructions

### Formatting Standards

- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include proper heading hierarchy
- Use bullet points and numbered lists appropriately
- Include TODO placeholders for customization
- Add checkboxes for progress tracking

### Technical Standards

- Templates should be technology-agnostic when possible
- Include flexibility for different project types
- Provide clear guidance for AI agents
- Include error handling and edge case considerations

## Submission Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Review your template** against the quality standards
2. **Test the template** by using it in a real scenario
3. **Check for typos** and formatting issues
4. **Ensure consistency** with existing templates

### How to Submit

1. **Create a Pull Request** with your new template
2. **Include a description** of what the template does and why it's useful
3. **Reference any related issues** or discussions
4. **Add yourself** to the contributors list (if desired)

### Pull Request Template
